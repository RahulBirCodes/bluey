TODOs:
- [ ] Find out what compute cluster we're training on => if tinker then easy if not need to finesse compute
- [ ] Write out pytorch code for models: 1. RMS norm with residual connections, 2. Layernorm learnable parameters with res connecs, 3. One without layernorm only, 4. One without layernorm without res connecs (optional harder).
- [ ] Dataloader code - least squares with parameterized input/output features
- [ ] Muon decisions - read kimik2 paper and make decisions on that
- [ ] Manifold muon decisions - understand manifold muon double ascent loop
- [ ] Write training loops for hparam sweep and training with wandb plotting
